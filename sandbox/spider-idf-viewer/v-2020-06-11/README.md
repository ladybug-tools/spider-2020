In this GitHub issue, Mostapha mentioned that we could view IDF files. In actual fact, the Spider team has a lot of 3D viewers but not one for IDF. So let's make one.

The core core are prepared. The Read Me is started.

It is worth considering that, as far as I know, I have never "seen" an IDF file. I have no clue as to what one should look like and how at should behave. I know 3D but I an a BEM newb.

We have Spider IDF Viewer! In two and a half hours. In 2015 it took me weeks to read OSM files and display in 3D. in 2017 it took me days to read gbXML files. Ditto RAD files. 

And now it's like "Pff"

As of now it's lines for walls, door and window borders. Let's get some surfaces in here

16:43 ~  

Now we have meshes - but only in beige. Let's see if we can get some color.

19:19 ~  

Now we have colors. And an "open all" button that opens and displays all the sample files in 3D.

And we have what are getting to be the usual features:

* Open files on you r computer
* Open files on the Internet
* Display surface data parameters when you click on a surface.

Added link to all 701 EnergyPlus testfiles. Started testing. None worked at first. Did a bunch of fixes. Now they seem to work mostly
