In this GitHub issue, Mostapha mentioned that we could view IDF files. In actual fact, the Spidrr team has a lot of 3D viewers but not one for IDF. So let's make one.

The core core are prepared. The Read Me is started.

It is worth considering that, as far as I know, I have never "seen" an IDF file. I have no clue as to what one should look like and how at should behave. I know 3D but I an a BEM newb.

We have Spider IDF Viewer! In two and a half hours. In 2015 it took me weeks to read OSM files and display in 3D. in 2017 it took me days to read gbXML files. Ditto RAD files. 

And now it's like "Pff"

As of now it's lines for walls, door and window borders. Let's get some surfaces in here
