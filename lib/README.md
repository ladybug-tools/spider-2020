## Concept

If a file type is used in two or more places, it should be available in lib

Canonical lib is at https://github.com/theo-armour/2020/tree/master/lib/

Not every repo needs all the lib files

Always make it easy to do a file compare and sync

Why not a single lib for all users and repos?

* Tried and failed
* Makes it difficult for new users
* Discourages simplicity, individuality and customization
