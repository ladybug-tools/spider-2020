_Spider gbXML Viewer_
@@@-->

### Full Screen: [Spider gbXML Viewer]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider-2020/spider-gbxml-viewer/ )


### Single page view [ Gallery gbXML Files]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider-2020/spider-gbxml-viewer-lt/gallery-gbxml-files.html )


## Concept

### File menu 

File sources
    * Open gbXML files using your operating system dialog box
    * Open gbXML files using a [RESTful API]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer ) - [REST API Tutorial]( https://restfulapi.net/ )

File menu types
    * Open both .XML and .GBXML files ( the latter is required by the [Autodesk Viewer]( https://viewer.autodesk.com/designviews )) 
    * Handle both 8-bit and 16-bit data
    * Open gbXML files inside compressed .ZIP files - asynchronously (first file only) 

File menu reports
    * Provide feedback on the name of the opened file, its size, the length of time it took to load and more

To Do

* Drag and drop support
* Reload most recently loaded local file
* Display the names of all the files in a compressed folder and enable de-compressing and opening a selected file

_Following are a work-in-progress_

### Sample files gallery

* Access extensive library with dozens of samples files


### View menu

* Follows standard Spider viewer menu protocols


### Data menu

* Uses Spider JSON Tree Viewer
* Converts XML data to JSON
* Reasonably fast and produces nice-looking output
* Complete gbXML data for entire file
* All data accessible with just a few clicks

### Quick access icons

* Select dark or light mode



## To do and wish list

* Getting ready for gbXML Webinar on July 16
* Data menu: button to highlight 3D surface
* View menu: add context menus to select boxes

* Footer > model icon > surface types: vertical || exposed to Sun etc

* "LT" version with gallery page



## Issues

* Better timing feedback with large files and progress indicators would be nice
* gbXML parser: fix mis-triangulation
